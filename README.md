# US_vs_WA_EV_Adoption-
This project analyzes electric vehicle (EV) adoption trends across the United States, with a special focus on Washington State. The goal is to benchmark Washington’s progress against national trends and explore the differences in adoption rates between battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). The analysis investigates how Washington’s EV leadership is shaped by policy incentives, consumer behavior, and regional disparities, offering valuable insights into how the state can continue to advance equitable clean transportation.

The project was completed using Python, employing tools such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. The datasets—sourced from the U.S. Department of Energy and the Washington State Department of Licensing—were standardized using consistent April 30 snapshots from 2017 to 2025 to ensure reliable year-over-year comparisons. Through 15 visualizations, the analysis examined national versus state-level adoption patterns, BEV and PHEV growth, and differences between urban and rural counties.

The findings show that Washington leads the nation in EV adoption, with BEVs driving most of the state’s growth since 2018. However, this progress is highly concentrated in urban counties, while rural regions lag due to limited infrastructure and affordability challenges. To address these disparities, the report recommends introducing tiered rural EV incentives, partnering with utilities to implement smart-charging programs, and expanding rural charging networks through state-supported grants. These strategies aim to balance growth and ensure that all communities benefit from the EV transition.

In conclusion, the analysis highlights Washington’s pivotal position as a national EV leader that now faces the challenge of sustaining growth equitably across regions. The project demonstrates how data-driven insights can guide policymakers, utilities, and automakers in making informed decisions that strengthen infrastructure, support affordability, and close the urban–rural gap. By continuing to apply these strategies, Washington can serve as a model for sustainable and inclusive EV adoption nationwide.
